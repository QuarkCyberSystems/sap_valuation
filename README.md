# SAP Valuation

SAP-style **Moving Average** and **Standard Cost** valuation kernels for ERPNext,
built on an **immutable stock ledger**: posted events are never modified or
deleted — every correction is a new, dated, linked event.

The SAP Moving Average (MAP) kernel is complete and UAT-ready. The SAP Standard
Cost kernel (monthly/year-to-date variance settlement) is the next phase and
plugs into the same foundation.

---

## Why this app exists

ERPNext's native valuation engine repairs history. A backdated entry, a landed
cost voucher, or a purchase invoice at a different rate triggers **Repost Item
Valuation**: future Stock Ledger Entries are recomputed and rewritten in place,
and GL entries are deleted and recreated to match. That design has real costs:

- **Auditability** — the ledger you see today is not the ledger that existed
  yesterday. Regulated and audit-heavy environments (IFRS, statutory audits)
  need every posted figure to stay exactly as posted.
- **GL/stock drift** — repost chains can desynchronise inventory value from the
  GL, and reconciliation differences are hard to trace after rows have been
  rewritten.
- **Unbounded propagation** — one backdated document can silently re-value
  months of downstream transactions.

SAP's inventory accounting takes the opposite stance: *first correct the past
explicitly, then value the future*. Prices are period-based; backdated postings
update their own period and flow forward through opening balances; price gaps
against negative stock post to a dedicated difference account (PRD); nothing is
ever recomputed retroactively.

This app implements that model for ERPNext:

1. **Immutable events** — append-only movement and valuation logs; corrections
   are reversing events linked to their originals.
2. **Period-based valuation** — posting is allowed only into the current open
   period and (until settled) the previous one. Older corrections post forward
   with an `original_period` reference.
3. **Bounded propagation** — a prior-period posting updates that period and the
   current opening (via a carryover bucket). Nothing else moves.
4. **GL derived from events, never repaired** — every stock GL line carries a
   `valuation_event_id`; the sum of tagged GL always equals the movement table,
   enforced by a hard reconciliation gate at period close.

## How it works

### Routing, not replacement

Nothing changes for existing items. Items opt in per item via
`valuation_method = "SAP Moving Average"` (or, later, `"SAP Standard Cost"`).
There is deliberately **no global toggle**.

```
stock voucher submit
        │
StockController.make_sl_entries          (companion fork branch)
        │
        ├── item has a registered kernel? ──► SAP posting kernel (this app)
        │                                       Validate period → Lock balances
        │                                       → Compute → Write, atomically:
        │                                       SME + IVE + period balance
        │                                       + SLE-compatible row + GL
        │
        └── everything else ──────────────► core stock_ledger.py, unchanged
```

The kernel still writes **SLE-compatible rows** (flagged
`posted_via_sap_kernel`) with correct quantities and values, so Bin, stock
reports and reconciliations keep working — but the core engine never recomputes
them, and no Repost Item Valuation is ever created for routed items.

### The three data layers

| Layer | DocType | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Movement | **Stock Movement Event** | Immutable physical quantity log (receipt, issue, transfer, count, cancellation) |
| Valuation | **Inventory Valuation Event** | Immutable value-change log; the source of truth behind every stock GL line |
| Period state | **Inventory Period Balance** | Per item(-warehouse) period buckets: fixed opening, carryover, receipts, issues, adjustments, revaluations, PRD, closing, MAP, negative-stock state |

Control layer: **Inventory Period** (five-state machine, one OPEN period per
company) and **Inventory Period Close** (continuity, event-to-GL identity,
orphan checks, and a strict GL-vs-movement-table reconciliation gate — default
tolerance 0.00, manual resolution only, no automatic write-offs).
An optional **Inventory Period Balance Snapshot** audit log records
Before/After images of every balance mutation.

### MAP rules implemented

- **Receipt** blends: `MAP = (value + qty×cost) / (qty_on_hand + qty)`.
- **Issues** always at the current period MAP — never a user-entered value.
- **Late costs** (landed cost vouchers, purchase-invoice price differences)
  split by the **Stock Ratio** `on_hand / received_since_last_zero`: the
  on-hand share enters inventory and moves MAP; the consumed share posts to
  Price Difference.
- **Foreign-currency invoice differences** (IFRS): the price component is
  measured at the *receipt* exchange rate and split by stock ratio; the FX
  movement goes to Exchange Gain/Loss and never touches inventory.
- **Negative stock** (configurable): MAP freezes; every receipt against
  negative stock posts `PRD = (price − frozen MAP) × qty` immediately; the
  receipt that crosses zero resets MAP to its own price and restarts the
  stock-ratio cycle.
- **Backdated postings** update the prior open period and flow into the
  current period through the carryover bucket. Backdating into a period that
  closed negative additionally posts a system-generated cross-period absorb
  entry so GL and stock stay identical (both the current-positive and
  current-negative sub-cases).
- **Returns with reference** are valued at the original document's unit cost
  (excluding landed-cost shares) and re-blend MAP; returns without reference
  post at current MAP.
- **Cancellation** is never `docstatus 2`. A *Create Cancellation* action posts
  a same-doctype reversal document that mirrors the original's GL on its own
  posting date; originals stay submitted; double reversals and cancellations
  into settled periods are blocked.
- **Quantity vs value separation**: **Stock Count** (MI07-style) accepts
  quantities only and values them at period MAP; **Stock Revaluation**
  (MR21-style) changes value only.
- **Zero-quantity cleanup** clears residual rounding value to a dedicated
  account and resets MAP and the stock-ratio counter.

## Installation & requirements

```bash
cd $PATH_TO_YOUR_BENCH
bench get-app https://github.com/QuarkCyberSystems/sap_valuation
bench --site <site> install-app sap_valuation
```

- Requires the companion ERPNext fork branch carrying the (deliberately
  minimal, ~190 line) core integration: the valuation-method options, the
  kernel-registry dispatch, the `posted_via_sap_kernel` guards, repost opt-out
  and stock-GL suppression for routed items. Every fork change is a no-op when
  this app is not installed.
- Per company, before the first posting: a **SAP Moving Average Settings**
  record (difference/variance accounts, precision, tolerances, negative-stock
  policy, return-valuation policy) and an **OPEN Inventory Period**.
- For the invoice-difference flow: Buying Settings → *Maintain Same Rate* off,
  and an adequate over-billing allowance.

## Extending (Standard Cost, or your own kernel)

Kernels register through hooks — no further core edits:

```python
# hooks.py
sap_valuation_kernels = {
    "SAP Moving Average": "sap_valuation.sap_moving_average.kernel.post_via_sap_ma_kernel",
}
sap_valuation_incoming_rate = "sap_valuation.shared.routing.get_incoming_rate"
sap_valuation_landed_cost = "sap_valuation.sap_moving_average.landed_cost.handle_landed_cost"
```

A kernel receives the submitting controller and its SLE dicts, and owns the
complete atomic write (events, period balances, SLE-compatible rows, GL).

## Testing

The behavioral spec is executable. Every rule above is enforced by:

- a **pure-Python reference simulator**
  (`sap_valuation/sap_moving_average/reference/`) with conformance tests
  reproducing the signed workbook anchors to the penny — run with
  `pytest sap_valuation/sap_moving_average/reference/`;
- three end-to-end smoke suites that drive **real vouchers** on a site and
  roll back:

```bash
bench --site <site> execute sap_valuation.tests.smoke_kernel.run   # core posting flow
bench --site <site> execute sap_valuation.tests.smoke_matrix.run   # full signed test matrix
bench --site <site> execute sap_valuation.tests.smoke_edges.run    # backdated/negative/FX/transfer edges
```

All suites assert the GL-inventory identity (sum of tagged GL = period-balance
closing value) after every scenario.

## Status
